# AI-Powered Neural Ecosystem (2030) (Task 5)

## Problem Addressed
Climate change induced biodiversity loss threatening ecosystem stability.

## Solution
AI-managed neural implants for keystone species that:
- Monitor animal health and stress levels
- Optimize migration patterns using swarm intelligence
- Predict and prevent human-wildlife conflicts

## Technical Workflow
1. Input: Animal biometrics + environmental sensors + satellite data
2. Model: Federated learning across species populations
3. Output: Adaptive conservation strategies

## Ethical Considerations
**Benefits**:
- Preserve endangered ecosystems
- Restore natural balances

**Risks**:
- Unintended behavioral modification
- Dependency on technological systems
