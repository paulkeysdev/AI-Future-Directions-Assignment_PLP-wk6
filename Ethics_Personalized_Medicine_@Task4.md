# AI Bias and Fairness in Personalized Medicine

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing personalized medicine by enabling predictive modeling, individualized treatment plans, and genome-based diagnostics. However, this advancement raises ethical concerns—especially around bias and fairness. In the field of cancer genomics, for instance, the data used to train AI models significantly underrepresents non-Caucasian populations. For example, over 78% of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset comprises data from Caucasian individuals, limiting the model’s ability to generalize outcomes across diverse populations, particularly those of African descent.

Socioeconomic disparities also contribute to bias. Patients from underprivileged backgrounds often lack access to genetic testing and advanced therapies, leading to uneven data collection and treatment outcomes. These disparities create feedback loops in which AI models continually learn from and reinforce unequal systems.

To mitigate these biases, multiple strategies can be employed. First, researchers should actively recruit diverse populations into genomic studies to ensure broader representation. Second, developers can embed fairness constraints during model training to reduce outcome disparities. Finally, continuous auditing of deployed models using real-world data can help identify and correct hidden biases over time.

One promising approach is the *Fairness Through Awareness* framework, which explicitly considers protected attributes (such as race or gender) during model development. This approach helps ensure that AI systems do not make decisions that inadvertently disadvantage certain groups, thereby promoting equity in medical outcomes.

In conclusion, while AI offers immense potential for personalized medicine, its ethical deployment requires deliberate attention to bias and fairness. Through inclusive data practices and fairness-aware design, we can build AI systems that serve all populations effectively and ethically.
